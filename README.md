## Build

Requires Rust and the WebView2 runtime (pre-installed on Windows 10/11).

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Output: `target/release/peekdown.exe`

## Releases

Push a version tag matching `Cargo.toml` (for example, `v1.2.1`). GitHub Actions builds the Windows executable and publishes it as a GitHub Release asset. The workflow uses the repository's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no personal access token or secret is needed.

To use Peekdown as the default app for `.md` or `.txt`, open the gear menu in Peekdown and select **Set .md and .txt default apps…**. Peekdown registers itself for the current Windows user and opens its Default apps page. Select Peekdown for each extension there. Keep the executable at the same path after choosing it.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — window management, file I/O, IPC ([tao](https://github.com/niceshell/niceshell) + [wry](https://github.com/niceshell/niceshell))
- **WebView2** — rendering engine (Edge, pre-installed on Win10/11)
- **marked.js** — markdown to HTML
- **highlight.js** — code syntax highlighting
- **No Electron, no Node, no bundler** — all frontend assets are embedded at compile time via `include_str!`
